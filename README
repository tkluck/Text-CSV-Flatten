Text-CSV-Flatten version 0.01
=============================

This module transforms hierarchical data (nested arrays/hashes) to
comma-separated value (csv) output according to a compact, readable,
user-specified pattern.

For example, the pattern '.<index>.*' transforms a data structure
of the form

    [{ a => 1, b => 2 }, { a => 3, b => 4 }]

to the CSV output

    a,b,index
    1,2,0
    3,4,1

The pattern '.*.*' applied to the same data gives the output

    0_a,0_b,1_a,1_b
    1,2,3,4

The pattern '.*.<key>' gives the output

    0,1,key
    1,3,a
    2,4,b

It is hoped that the pattern specification is sufficiently powerful for this
module to replace a lot of simple boiler-plate data transformations.
